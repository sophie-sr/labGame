## Overview

### Concept

As a scientist, you've recently been working day and night in the lab on a potential cure for cancer. However, on the day you create the final prototype, based on multiple years' worth of data, an accident happens. You and your lab partners become tiny! Explore through your lab from a new point of view to find a way to return to normal. Along the way, find hints of what could have happened during the experiment. Was it an error on your own part... or was it not?

### Gameplay Mechanics

Move around and complete parkour sections by jumping and moving with the arrow keys and complete puzzles (to be implemented) to try to move from one level to the next. The game can support from 1 to 2 players for both local and online play. Play as the scientist (P1) and the lab assistant (P2) to complete puzzles together.

### Technology

We used the Godot game engine as it is free and open-source. Also, the language used by Godot is GDScript, a dynamically typed scripting language similar to Python specifically made for use in Godot.

### Challenges

Merging was a big challenge for us. We couldn't automate version management for our project due to an issue with Git on one member's laptop. As a result, we allotted time towards the end to complete the merge together, with the least intricate code being merged with more intricate code and so forth.
Another challenge was that for most group members, this was the first game that they had created a game. Therefore becoming accustomed to the game engine as well as its language took a bit of time. To solve this issue, team members spent time looking at tutorials on the basics of Godot, especially related to 2D platformers.

### For the Future...

We plan on adding puzzles and more levels to help improve gameplay interest, as well as help develop the story as you play. Assets will also be improved, and already existing code will be cleaned up.
